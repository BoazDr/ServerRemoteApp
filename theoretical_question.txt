Saving the token locally:
Pro: we don't have an extra serverCall therefore we make the application faster.
Con: The applicaion is more sensitive to internal changes

Re-requesting a token from the server each time:
Pro:  The applicaion is less sensitive to internal changes, changes on the server for example won't influence client's data updates etc..
Con: A serverCall is added, and it might slow our applciaiton.
